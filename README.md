Monocle
=======

Monocle, or MOE (for MOnocle Engine) is a 3D rendering engine I develop on my spare time.

With it, I'd like to experiment with common features of modern game engines.

I work on this project mainly for educational and research purposes.
It has various inspirations, from technical articles (especially from [Molecule](https://blog.molecular-matters.com/) and [Bitsquid](http://bitsquid.blogspot.fr/) developers) to engines I have worked with (Unreal, idTech, Dunia).

Feel free to explore the code and the techniques used in this project. That's why I made it open source.


Building
========

To build Monocle, you need CMake.

Once you have it and you have cloned the repository, everything should be very standard CMake procedure: point it to the CMakeLists.txt and just generate the solution.

To build unit tests, make sure you tick the Monocle_BUILD_UNIT_TESTS option to true !
